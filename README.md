# ðŸ˜‰You can check your Github Following & Follower

### Aren't you curious about who is following you or who are you following?ðŸ¤”

### I have a follow/unfollow check service on Instagram, but it's not on GitHub, so I just made it for fun.


### It is very Simple. All you have to do is enter the GitHub handle.
Just Try `curl localhost:8080/check/{your github handle}`
